# Atlas-of-human-oriented-growing-skull-statistical-Shape-Models
This depository provides a set of 19 Statistical Shape Models of human skulls spanning birth to adulthood.
	⁃	In this folder, you will find several files.
	⁃	
	⁃	Case Atlas table.pdf  Is a table where you will find the sex and age of each of the patients for whom CT scan has been used and which have been used in the creation of the Skull Atlas.
	⁃	Date to days.xlsx is a small Excel workbook to help you calculate the age in days of your case. Enter the birth date and the date of acquiring the CT scan, and you will have the age in days.
	⁃	Links to the tutorials in YouTube. The tutorials on YouTube about vestibular orientation and skull superposition will help you use the Skull Atlas.
	⁃	                    The Link to YouTube’s Video: Vestibular orientation with 3DSlicer is https://youtu.be/Bs4GWLrFQfA
	⁃	                    The Link to YouTube’s Video:  skull superposition in 3DSlicer is https://youtu.be/hJTWZDnqZ3k
	⁃		⁃	Some Advice when performing Superposition in V.O.: 
	⁃	Open 3DSlicer.
	⁃	Load, first the Skull Atlas ??-?? .mfr file.
	⁃	Load the Subject of interest secondly (SOI), so the orientation with the above displayed tool will be easy.
	⁃	Create a new transform of the SOI subject folder and align
	⁃	Then save, the name of the SOI will come first.

	⁃	Planche OV laterale 300-18.jpg is a picture where a lateral view of each of the nineteen Skull Atlases has been merged. All views are at the same scale with their own ruler.
	⁃	Skull Atlas ####-####d.mrb are nineteen files, which are 3DSlicer bundles. When opened with 3DSlicer, they include a 3D model statistically created from a set of models (see the Case Atlas table over) aged from #### to ####days.
	⁃	In this new issue, 17/09/2025, the files have been improved, notably the models have been oriented according to the 3D Box, which means that you can set the correct orientation of this model by clicking in the box in the right superior angle of any 3D display.
	⁃	Skull Atlas ####-####d.obj are the models in .obj format if you prefer to use them with other applications than 3D Slicer.
	⁃	Skull Atlas over Satanin's chart: is a display of the chart of brain growth according to Satanin, where the area of the group of CT scans’ age range is superposed.
	⁃	Details about the Atlas’s construction and use may be found in this peer-reviewed paper in the Journal of Craniofacial Surgery. DOI: 10.1097/SCS.0000000000012132
